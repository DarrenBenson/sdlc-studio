# LATEST - current project state (v3.6.0 released; v4 is WIP)

> The current-state anchor - a WINDOW, not a ledger. **Re-read this and run
> `/sdlc-studio status` after any context reset or compaction.** Durable guidance lives in
> AGENTS.md; per-sprint detail lives in the retros and CHANGELOG.md; keep this file under
> `docs.latest_max_lines` (doc-freshness advisory) by moving past sprints to History lines.
>
> **Released version:** 3.6.0 (2026-07-06, non-breaking - the EP0016 review/lite on-ramp) ·
> **Date:** 2026-07-09 ·
> **Gates:** lint clean, 1444 script tests pass (+repo-only tools tests), `gate` PASS,
> reconcile drift 0, npm audit 0, CI green on main.
>
> **v4 is WORK-IN-PROGRESS, not released.** The v4 foundation (schema-v3 ULID identity - a
> breaking change) and Tranche 2 (authorship/enforcement + tooling debt) are all on `main` and
> ship **dormant** in v3.6.0: opt-in via `schema_version: 3` (defaults to 2), so v3.6.0 stays
> non-breaking and nothing renumbers. v4.0 is cut only once the backlog is complete AND it has
> been tested in anger on real projects.
>
> **Release freeze until v4.0 (operator directive 2026-07-08):** nothing releases to consuming
> projects before the v4.0 tag - all new v4-line work accumulates on `main` era-gated behind
> `schema_version: 3`. Commits land locally; the push/release waits for v4. `main` runs ahead
> of `origin` by design during the freeze.

## Current

- **EP0022 + EP0023 DELIVERED (2026-07-09).** RV0006 debt clearance + context tiering: 5 units, all
  Done + conformant, both epics Done; committed to `main` (unpushed, freeze holds). US0102 shared
  `find_by_id`/`story_epic` + `reconcile --format json` parity; US0100 SHA-pinned Actions +
  `check_action_pins.sh` guard + installer sha256 verification; US0101 `github_sync` secret scan +
  `http` scheme/host floor + `.gitignore` hardening; US0104 context-tiering digests (`status`/`hint`
  read a filename-keyed digest, dormant below `digests.min_closed` 500; `artifact_files` refactored
  onto `iter_artifact_files`); US0103 three complexity hotspots decomposed + `SDLC_DEBUG`/`roll_jsonl`
  diagnostics + small cleanups. Closes CR0186/CR0187/CR0179. 1444 script tests, gate PASS, drift 0.
  6 adversarial reviews (5 unit + 1 closing full-diff), a real finding in 2 units (US0100 bash-4
  macOS portability, US0101 shipped provenance tag), 0 shipped unaddressed; follow-up CR0201 filed
  (lint provenance-guard blind spot) - see RETRO0015.
- **Backlog after EP0022/EP0023:** v4.0 release engineering CR0198/CR0199; CR0201 (lint
  provenance-guard blind spot, filed this sprint). Deferred follow-ups: a `reconcile detect --era`
  lens + per-artifact re-review markers + per-capability watermarks (CR0197 open decisions); a
  path-aware tightening of the spec-guard basename match; the pre-existing v3 ULID/validate
  id-format mismatch. The RV0006 debt grab-bags (CR0186/CR0187) and context tiering (CR0179) are
  now Complete.
- **Benchmark evidence base (N=5, `2026-07-08-n5-run.md`):** unstructured arms escaped 10/10 on
  notify-digest vs mandated-planning 2/5 (Fisher p 0.083); Auditability tracked escapes (R 0.88 >
  A 0.68 > B 0.60); routing 0.40 cost index, ~3.1x baseline tokens. Failure mode "a bad plan
  propagates" -> CR0194. Positioning docs cite these numbers.

## Operating reminders

- Trunk-based: small green commits to main, each gated on `npm run lint && npm test && gate`.
- Forward-port skill edits repo -> install targets via manual rsync (not `install.sh --local`).
- Stakes-scaled review (CR0061): full independent critic for code/risky units; lighter recorded
  review for pure-doc/mechanical ones.
- Consuming projects only receive features when a release is TAGGED - a fat [Unreleased]
  changelog is a standing prompt to propose one.
