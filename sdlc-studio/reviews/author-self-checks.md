# Author Self-Checks

> Append-only. The author's own claim inventory and mutation pass per unit, recorded by
> `critic.py self-check record` before a reviewer is briefed. The digest is over the
> content of the unit's Affects files when the row was written, so a row whose digest no
> longer matches is a self-check of an earlier diff.
