## Summary

The lane-yield note's wording, and its untested refusal count; a style nit at `test_lean_lane_yield.py`:276. Reported non-blocking at review.

## Steps to Reproduce

Read the sentence against the behaviour the review probed.

## Proposed Fix

Reword to what the code does.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1** Given the page or output named, its wording states only what the code does. Fails on: the over-claim the review quoted.
  - **Verify:** pytest .claude/skills/sdlc-studio/scripts/tests/test_lean_lane_yield.py
