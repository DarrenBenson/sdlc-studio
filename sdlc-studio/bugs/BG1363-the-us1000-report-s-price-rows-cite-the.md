## Summary

Rows cite `PRICES_SOURCE` (`sprint_report.py`:4560) but read the envelope's `price_table`, so a reader following the source can find a different number; the delegated-reach clause also over-counts what it priced. Reported non-blocking at review.

## Steps to Reproduce

Read the sentence against the behaviour the review probed.

## Proposed Fix

Reword to what the code does.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1** Given the page or output named, its wording states only what the code does. Fails on: the over-claim the review quoted.
  - **Verify:** pytest .claude/skills/sdlc-studio/scripts/tests/test_report_pricing_snapshot.py
