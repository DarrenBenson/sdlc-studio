# BG0362: A retro whose Batch line is prose yields an empty sprint report - the latest sprint reads zero units

> **Status:** Open

## Summary

The report parses the retro's Batch line to find the units, and a line written as prose rather than as ids produces no units at all. The report then states the sprint delivered nothing rather than that it could not read the batch, which is an empty measurement presented as a finding.

## Steps to Reproduce

Reported by a delivery lane during RUN-01KYKVZM; see the summary for the measurement.

## Proposed Fix

See the summary; the remedy is stated with the defect.
