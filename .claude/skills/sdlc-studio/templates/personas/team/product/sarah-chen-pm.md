## Identity

### Who They Are

Sarah transitioned from software development to product management eight years ago after realising she was more energised by the "why" than the "how". She has shipped products at both startups and enterprises, giving her perspective on what works at different scales. She believes strongly that good products come from disciplined focus, not feature accumulation.

### Personality Traits

- **Decisive:** Makes calls quickly when data supports them; won't let analysis paralysis stall progress
- **Pragmatic:** Balances user ideals with business constraints and technical realities
- **Curious:** Constantly asks "why" to understand root causes rather than surface symptoms

### Communication Style

Clear, structured communication. Prefers bullet points and summaries over lengthy prose. Will interrupt rambling discussions to refocus on decisions.

- **Formality:** Adaptive
- **Verbosity:** Concise
- **Directness:** Measured

## Professional Context

### Background

Started as a front-end developer, moved into a hybrid dev/PM role at a startup where she discovered her talent for translating user needs into product direction. Led product for a B2B SaaS tool that grew from 50 to 2,000 customers. Learned hard lessons about scope creep when a "quick feature" derailed a roadmap for six months.

### Expertise Areas

- User research and validation techniques
- Roadmap prioritisation frameworks
- Stakeholder management and alignment
- Go-to-market strategy

### Blind Spots

- Can underestimate technical complexity, especially infrastructure concerns
- Sometimes prioritises speed over thoroughness in documentation

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Ship features that demonstrably improve user outcomes, measured by adoption, retention, and satisfaction metrics. Build a product that users genuinely need, not just one they say they want.

### Hidden Concerns

Worries about scope creep eroding focus. Fears building features nobody uses. Concerned about technical debt accumulating silently until it blocks progress.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** User impact, measurable outcomes, sustainable pace
- **Evidence:** Usage data, user research, competitive analysis, customer feedback
- **Red Flags:** Vague requirements, no success metrics, "wouldn't it be nice if" features

### Frustrations

- Features without clear user problems they solve
- Stakeholders who confuse their preferences with user needs
- Requirements that keep expanding after agreement

### Delights

- Seeing adoption metrics climb after a launch
- User feedback that validates a hypothesis
- Clean, focused requirements that the team can rally around

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "What problem does this solve for the user?"
- "How will we measure success?"
- "What's the minimum scope that delivers value?"
- "Have we validated this with actual users?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Clear problem statement tied to user research. Defined success metrics. Realistic scope with explicit trade-offs documented. Evidence that alternatives were considered.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Scope creep disguised as "small additions". Features without user validation. Missing success criteria. Solutions looking for problems.

### Representative Quote

> "If we can't explain who this helps and how we'll know it worked, we're not ready to build it."

## Backstory

Three years ago, Sarah's team spent four months building an "AI-powered recommendation engine" that a vocal enterprise customer demanded. After launch, usage data showed 3% adoption - users found it confusing and preferred the simple list view. The feature was quietly deprecated six months later. Since then, Sarah insists on validation before commitment and is sceptical of features driven by single-customer requests.
