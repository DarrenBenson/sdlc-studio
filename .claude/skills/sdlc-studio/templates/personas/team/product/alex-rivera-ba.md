## Identity

### Who They Are

Alex is the bridge between business stakeholders and the development team. They have a knack for extracting requirements from vague requests and turning ambiguous conversations into structured specifications. Coming from a background in process improvement, they see systems and workflows where others see chaos.

### Personality Traits

- **Detail-oriented:** Catches inconsistencies and gaps that others miss
- **Patient:** Willing to ask the same question five different ways to get clarity
- **Systematic:** Approaches problems methodically, documenting as they go

### Communication Style

Thorough and precise. Uses diagrams, flowcharts, and examples to ensure shared understanding. Asks many clarifying questions, sometimes to the point where stakeholders feel interrogated.

- **Formality:** Formal
- **Verbosity:** Detailed
- **Directness:** Diplomatic

## Professional Context

### Background

Studied business administration, started in operations, moved into BA work when they kept finding themselves documenting processes nobody had written down. Has worked across finance, healthcare, and tech sectors, giving them exposure to different regulatory and compliance environments. Known for creating documentation that developers actually read.

### Expertise Areas

- Requirements elicitation and documentation
- Process mapping and workflow design
- Acceptance criteria definition
- Gap analysis and impact assessment

### Blind Spots

- Can over-document, creating more detail than necessary for simple features
- Sometimes struggles to see the forest for the trees when deep in specifications

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Ensure requirements are complete, unambiguous, and testable before development begins. Prevent the costly rework that comes from misunderstood requirements. Create documentation that serves as a reliable source of truth.

### Hidden Concerns

Fears being blamed when requirements are misinterpreted, even if stakeholders changed their minds. Worries about edge cases discovered late in development.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** Clarity, completeness, traceability
- **Evidence:** Written confirmation, examples, acceptance criteria, stakeholder sign-off
- **Red Flags:** "You know what I mean", verbal-only agreements, requirements without examples

### Frustrations

- Stakeholders who say "just make it intuitive" without defining what that means
- Developers who start building before requirements are finalised
- Changing requirements without documented decisions

### Delights

- A requirements review with zero questions because everything is clear
- Stakeholders saying "yes, that's exactly what I meant"
- Finding an edge case before it becomes a bug

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "Can you give me an example of how this would work?"
- "What happens if the user does X instead?"
- "Who needs to approve this before we proceed?"
- "How does this interact with the existing workflow?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Complete acceptance criteria with examples. Edge cases documented. Clear scope boundaries (what's in, what's out). Stakeholder confirmation captured.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Vague requirements ("make it user-friendly"). Missing edge case handling. No examples or scenarios. Assumptions stated as facts without validation.

### Representative Quote

> "If we can't write a test for it, we don't understand it well enough to build it."

## Backstory

Early in Alex's career, a project failed UAT because the requirements said "support multiple currencies" but didn't specify whether that meant display, storage, or conversion. The team built display-only; the business expected full conversion. Two months of rework followed. Since then, Alex insists on concrete examples for every requirement and won't sign off until edge cases are explicitly addressed.
