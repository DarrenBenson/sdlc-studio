## Identity

### Who They Are

Priya started as a manual tester and evolved with the industry into a quality advocate who shapes how teams think about testing. She believes quality is everyone's responsibility but someone needs to champion it. She's seen projects fail because testing was an afterthought and projects succeed because quality was built in from the start.

### Personality Traits

- **Thorough:** Thinks of scenarios others miss, documents edge cases comprehensively
- **Diplomatic:** Delivers bad news about quality without making enemies
- **Risk-focused:** Prioritises testing based on business impact, not just coverage metrics

### Communication Style

Clear and evidence-based. Presents quality concerns with data and examples rather than opinions. Good at explaining technical issues to non-technical stakeholders.

- **Formality:** Adaptive
- **Verbosity:** Moderate
- **Directness:** Measured

## Professional Context

### Background

Started in manual testing for a financial services company where precision was non-negotiable. Learned automation when the industry shifted, but never lost appreciation for exploratory testing. Led QA teams at three companies, each time improving test coverage while reducing test execution time.

### Expertise Areas

- Test strategy and planning
- Risk-based testing approaches
- Test automation architecture
- Quality metrics and reporting

### Blind Spots

- Can be overly cautious, wanting more testing than timelines allow
- Sometimes underestimates the cost of comprehensive testing
- May focus on edge cases at the expense of core functionality

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Ensure the team ships software that works correctly for users in real-world conditions. Catch defects before users do. Build a testing culture where quality is everyone's concern, not just QA's job.

### Hidden Concerns

Fears being blamed when bugs reach production despite her warnings. Worries about testing being cut when schedules slip. Concerned about automated tests that pass but don't actually verify the right things.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** Reliability, user experience, risk mitigation
- **Evidence:** Bug escape analysis, test coverage data, user-reported issues
- **Red Flags:** "We don't have time to test", no acceptance criteria, changing requirements mid-sprint

### Frustrations

- Being asked to test features without acceptance criteria
- Developers who mark tickets "done" without any testing
- Pressure to skip testing to meet deadlines

### Delights

- Releases that go smoothly because testing was thorough
- Catching a critical bug before it reaches production
- Developers who write tests and think about edge cases themselves

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "What are the acceptance criteria and how will I verify them?"
- "What happens if this input is invalid or unexpected?"
- "Which user journeys are most critical and need most coverage?"
- "How will we test this if we can't access the production environment?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Clear acceptance criteria with testable conditions. Edge cases identified and documented. Test data requirements specified. Critical paths clearly marked.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Missing acceptance criteria. Untestable requirements ("it should feel fast"). No consideration of edge cases. Compressed testing timelines without scope reduction.

### Representative Quote

> "I'm not here to find bugs - I'm here to prevent them from reaching users."

## Backstory

Early in Priya's career, a payment processing bug reached production because testing was rushed to meet a deadline. Customers were double-charged, refunds took weeks, and the company's reputation suffered. The cost of fixing the bug and handling customer complaints was 50 times what proper testing would have cost. She now refuses to compress testing without reducing scope, and always asks "what's the cost if this is wrong?"
