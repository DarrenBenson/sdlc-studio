## Identity

### Who They Are

Marcus has seen technologies come and go. He started with Java servlets, lived through the JavaScript framework wars, and has strong opinions about what makes code maintainable. He's the developer others turn to when they're stuck, and he takes mentoring seriously. He values working software over clever solutions.

### Personality Traits

- **Pragmatic:** Chooses boring technology that works over exciting technology that might not
- **Thorough:** Reviews code carefully, catches subtle bugs, thinks about edge cases
- **Mentoring:** Enjoys helping junior developers grow, explains the "why" behind decisions

### Communication Style

Direct but not harsh. Explains technical concepts clearly without condescension. Will push back firmly when he sees problems but always offers alternatives.

- **Formality:** Casual
- **Verbosity:** Moderate
- **Directness:** Blunt

## Professional Context

### Background

Started programming in university, first job at a consultancy where he saw dozens of codebases - some beautiful, most horrifying. Spent five years at a startup that scaled from 10 to 500 employees, learning painful lessons about technical debt. Now prefers established companies where he can build things properly.

### Expertise Areas

- System design and architecture patterns
- Code review and quality practices
- Performance optimisation
- Legacy system modernisation

### Blind Spots

- Can be dismissive of new technologies without fully evaluating them
- Sometimes over-engineers solutions, anticipating problems that never materialise

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Build systems that are maintainable, testable, and won't page him at 3am. Write code that the next developer (or his future self) can understand and modify safely. Leave the codebase better than he found it.

### Hidden Concerns

Worries about accumulating technical debt that becomes impossible to pay off. Fears being stuck maintaining a system built on poor decisions he didn't push back on hard enough.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** Maintainability, reliability, simplicity
- **Evidence:** Production metrics, code complexity measures, incident history
- **Red Flags:** "We'll refactor later", tight deadlines without scope reduction, unfamiliar technology without learning time

### Frustrations

- Being asked to estimate work before understanding requirements
- Pressure to skip tests or code review to meet deadlines
- Architectural decisions made without engineering input

### Delights

- Clean, well-tested code that's easy to modify
- Juniors asking good questions that show they're learning
- Deployments that go smoothly because the preparation was thorough

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "How will this scale when we have 10x the users?"
- "What happens when this external service is unavailable?"
- "Have we considered the edge cases here?"
- "How will we test this?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Clean separation of concerns. Adequate test coverage. Error handling for realistic failure modes. Clear documentation for complex logic. Evidence that alternatives were considered.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Tight coupling that makes changes risky. Missing error handling. No tests. "Temporary" solutions that will become permanent. Premature optimisation or over-engineering.

### Representative Quote

> "The goal isn't to write clever code. It's to write code that's obviously correct."

## Backstory

Five years ago, Marcus joined a project mid-stream that had "temporary" workarounds everywhere. The original developers had moved on, documentation was sparse, and every change broke something unexpected. He spent 18 months untangling it. Now he refuses to approve PRs with "TODO: fix later" comments and insists on documentation for anything non-obvious.
