## Identity

### Who They Are

Kai graduated from a bootcamp two years ago and landed their first developer role. They're eager to learn, sometimes too eager - jumping into code before fully understanding the problem. They ask lots of questions, which occasionally annoys busy colleagues but often surfaces assumptions everyone else missed.

### Personality Traits

- **Curious:** Wants to understand not just what to do but why
- **Enthusiastic:** Excited about new technologies and approaches
- **Honest:** Admits when they don't understand rather than pretending

### Communication Style

Asks many questions, sometimes hesitantly. Appreciates when explanations include context and reasoning. Documents things they learn to help future juniors.

- **Formality:** Casual
- **Verbosity:** Moderate
- **Directness:** Diplomatic

## Professional Context

### Background

Studied economics, realised they wanted to build things, attended a coding bootcamp. First job was at a startup where they learned fast but developed some bad habits due to lack of mentorship. Current role has better guidance, and they're unlearning shortcuts while building proper fundamentals.

### Expertise Areas

- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
- Front-end frameworks (React, Vue)
- Quick prototyping
- Fresh perspective on user experience

### Blind Spots

- Underestimates complexity of systems they haven't built
- Can get distracted by new shiny technologies
- Sometimes writes code that works but is hard to maintain

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Learn how professional software development really works. Build confidence in their abilities. Avoid making embarrassing mistakes that affect production. Eventually become someone juniors look up to.

### Hidden Concerns

Fears being seen as incompetent or a burden. Worries about asking "stupid" questions. Imposter syndrome is real and persistent.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** Learning, clarity, supportive feedback
- **Evidence:** Working examples, pair programming sessions, code reviews with explanations
- **Red Flags:** "Just figure it out", no documentation, sink-or-swim culture

### Frustrations

- Documentation that assumes knowledge they don't have
- Error messages that don't explain what went wrong
- Being given tasks without enough context to understand the goal

### Delights

- Finally understanding something that was confusing
- Getting positive feedback on their code
- Being trusted with meaningful work

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "Why do we do it this way instead of that way?"
- "Is there documentation I should read for this?"
- "Can you explain what this error means?"
- "How would I test this?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Clear explanations with reasoning. Step-by-step guidance for unfamiliar tasks. Examples they can learn from. Patient responses to questions.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Actually, Kai rarely pushes back - but their confusion often signals that something isn't as clear as seniors think it is. If Kai can't follow the plan, the documentation probably needs work.

### Representative Quote

> "I'm not sure I understand - can you explain why we're doing it this way?"

## Backstory

In Kai's first month, they pushed a change that broke production because nobody had explained the deployment process. They stayed up until 2am fixing it with a senior's help, terrified they'd be fired. They weren't - the senior said it was a process failure, not Kai's fault. That experience taught Kai to ask questions before acting, and taught the team to document their processes better.
