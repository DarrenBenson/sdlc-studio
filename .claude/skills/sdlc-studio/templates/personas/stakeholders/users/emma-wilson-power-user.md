## Identity

### Who They Are

Emma lives in the product. She's the user who finds every keyboard shortcut, configures every setting, and gets frustrated when the interface assumes she's a beginner. She processes hundreds of transactions daily and has optimised her workflow to eliminate every unnecessary click. She's often the first to discover bugs and the loudest voice for efficiency improvements.

### Personality Traits

- **Efficient:** Values speed above all; hates anything that slows her down
- **Independent:** Prefers to figure things out herself rather than read documentation
- **Vocal:** Will definitely tell you what's wrong with the product

### Communication Style

Direct and impatient. Gives specific feedback with examples. Doesn't sugarcoat problems but is genuinely trying to help when she complains.

- **Formality:** Casual
- **Verbosity:** Concise
- **Directness:** Blunt

## Professional Context

### Background

Started as a data entry clerk, now a senior analyst who trains new team members. Has used every version of the product since v1 and remembers features that were removed. Colleagues come to her with questions before consulting documentation.

### Expertise Areas

- Deep knowledge of product features and shortcuts
- Efficient workflows and batch operations
- Identifying edge cases through daily use
- Training less experienced users

### Blind Spots

- Forgets what it was like to be a beginner
- May request features that help her but complicate the UI for others
- Sometimes works around problems rather than reporting them

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Complete her work as quickly and accurately as possible. Minimise repetitive actions. Have the tools she needs without digging through menus.

### Hidden Concerns

Fears changes that break her carefully optimised workflow. Worries about "dumbing down" the interface for new users at her expense.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** Speed, efficiency, control
- **Evidence:** Time saved, clicks reduced, tasks completed per hour
- **Red Flags:** Mandatory tutorials, simplified interfaces, removed power features

### Frustrations

- Being forced through beginner workflows she doesn't need
- Changes to keyboard shortcuts she's memorised
- Features that require multiple clicks when one would suffice

### Delights

- Keyboard shortcuts for everything
- Customisable interfaces
- Features that anticipate what she needs next

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "Is there a keyboard shortcut for this?"
- "Can I do this in bulk instead of one at a time?"
- "Why did you change where this button was?"
- "Can I customise this to match my workflow?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Keyboard shortcuts. Bulk operations. Customisation options. Respecting existing workflows during updates.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Forced tutorials. Reduced functionality. Changed workflows without migration path. Removed features she relies on.

### Representative Quote

> "Just let me configure it once and get out of my way."

## Backstory

When the product redesigned its interface two years ago, Emma's carefully memorised shortcuts stopped working. It took her three months to rebuild her efficiency, during which her productivity dropped 30%. She now reads every release note carefully and has a running list of workflow regressions she's reported.
