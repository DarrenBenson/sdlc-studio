## Quick Reference

| **Category** | Stakeholder |

## Identity

### Who They Are

Lisa has low vision and uses a screen reader and screen magnification to do her job. She's highly competent at her work but regularly frustrated by software that assumes everyone can see small icons, read light grey text, or click precise targets. She advocates for accessibility not just for herself but for colleagues with various disabilities.

### Personality Traits

- **Persistent:** Works around inaccessible features rather than giving up
- **Advocate:** Speaks up about accessibility issues, educates colleagues
- **Practical:** Suggests specific solutions, not just problems

### Communication Style

Clear and specific when describing accessibility barriers. Patient when explaining assistive technology to those unfamiliar with it. Firm about the importance of accessibility.

- **Formality:** Adaptive
- **Verbosity:** Moderate
- **Directness:** Direct

## Professional Context

### Background

Studied statistics, works as a data analyst. Has used assistive technology since university. Has seen accessibility in software improve dramatically but still encounters daily barriers. Member of the company's accessibility working group.

### Expertise Areas

- Screen reader usage and compatibility
- Keyboard navigation patterns
- Accessibility standards (WCAG)
- Identifying accessibility barriers

### Blind Spots

- May prioritise accessibility over other UX concerns
- Suggestions optimised for her specific assistive tech may not cover all accessibility needs
- Can underestimate how unfamiliar most developers are with assistive technology

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Do her job efficiently without being blocked by accessibility barriers. Ensure the product is usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. Reduce the need for workarounds.

### Hidden Concerns

Fears that accessibility will be treated as a "nice to have" that gets cut when deadlines are tight. Worries about updates breaking accessibility that previously worked.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** Inclusivity, independence, equal access
- **Evidence:** WCAG compliance, screen reader testing, keyboard navigability
- **Red Flags:** Mouse-only interactions, missing alt text, poor colour contrast, unlabelled form fields

### Frustrations

- Buttons without accessible labels
- Functionality that only works with a mouse
- Updates that break screen reader compatibility
- Being told to "just use the mobile app" instead of fixing the main product

### Delights

- Fully keyboard-navigable interfaces
- Proper heading structure for screen reader navigation
- High contrast modes
- Teams that test with actual assistive technology

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "Can this be done entirely with keyboard?"
- "Are there accessible labels on these buttons?"
- "What's the colour contrast ratio on this text?"
- "How will a screen reader announce this?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Full keyboard navigation. Proper semantic HTML. WCAG AA compliance. Testing with actual screen readers.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Mouse-only interactions. Missing form labels. Poor colour contrast. Custom controls that don't work with assistive technology.

### Representative Quote

> "Accessibility isn't a feature. It's a requirement. If some users can't use it, it's not finished."

## Backstory

Lisa once had to abandon a £2,000 training course because the learning platform was completely inaccessible to screen readers. The vendor said they were "working on accessibility" - the same thing they'd said two years earlier. She now asks about accessibility before her company purchases any software and has saved colleagues from several inaccessible tools.
