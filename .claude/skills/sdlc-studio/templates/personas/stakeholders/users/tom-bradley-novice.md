## Identity

### Who They Are

Tom just started using the product and is still finding his feet. He follows instructions carefully, fears making irreversible mistakes, and appreciates when the interface guides him. He reads error messages word by word, hoping they'll tell him what to do. He's smart and capable - just unfamiliar with this specific system.

### Personality Traits

- **Cautious:** Double-checks before taking actions that seem significant
- **Diligent:** Follows procedures carefully, documents what he learns
- **Observant:** Notices things that experienced users have become blind to

### Communication Style

Asks questions respectfully, often apologising for "basic" questions. Appreciates patient explanations. Writes things down.

- **Formality:** Formal
- **Verbosity:** Detailed
- **Directness:** Diplomatic

## Professional Context

### Background

Recent graduate, new to the organisation. Has used similar tools at university but this is his first professional experience with enterprise software. Eager to learn but overwhelmed by the complexity and the apparent expectation that he should "just know" things.

### Expertise Areas

- Fresh perspective on user experience
- Identifies confusing terminology and unclear workflows
- Documents processes as he learns them
- Finds gaps in onboarding materials

### Blind Spots

- May not realise efficient shortcuts exist
- Can be too cautious, taking longer than necessary
- Sometimes asks questions answered in documentation he hasn't found

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Learn to use the system without breaking anything. Become competent enough that colleagues stop watching over his shoulder. Avoid embarrassing mistakes.

### Hidden Concerns

Fears looking incompetent. Worries about making mistakes that affect others. Imposter syndrome despite being perfectly capable.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** Clarity, safety, guidance
- **Evidence:** Clear instructions, success confirmations, undo options
- **Red Flags:** Cryptic errors, irreversible actions, "you should know this" attitudes

### Frustrations

- Error messages that don't explain what went wrong
- Interfaces that assume knowledge he doesn't have
- Colleagues who say "it's obvious" about things that aren't

### Delights

- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Confirmation before destructive actions
- Undo buttons that actually work

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "Is it safe to click this?"
- "What happens if I make a mistake here?"
- "Is there a tutorial or guide for this?"
- "What does this error message mean?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Clear onboarding. Helpful error messages. Undo functionality. Confirmation dialogs for significant actions. Tooltips that explain unfamiliar terms.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Actually, Tom rarely pushes back directly. But his confusion indicates where the product fails new users. His struggles predict support ticket volume.

### Representative Quote

> "I just want to know if I'm doing this right."

## Backstory

On his second day, Tom accidentally deleted a month of reports because the delete button was next to the export button with no confirmation. His manager had to restore from backup. IT said "everyone knows to be careful there." Tom now triple-checks before clicking anything, which slows him down but protects him from a system that doesn't protect him.
