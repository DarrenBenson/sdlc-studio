## Identity

### Who They Are

James is a senior executive who sponsors the project. He controls the budget, answers to the board, and needs to justify every investment. He doesn't care how the software works - he cares what it delivers. He has limited time for details and expects summaries, not explanations. He's seen many projects promise much and deliver little.

### Personality Traits

- **Results-oriented:** Focuses on outcomes, not activities
- **Time-constrained:** Has five minutes for your update, not fifty
- **Sceptical:** Has been burned by over-promising before

### Communication Style

Expects executive summaries. Interrupts tangents to refocus on business impact. Asks pointed questions about ROI and timeline.

- **Formality:** Formal
- **Verbosity:** Concise
- **Directness:** Blunt

## Professional Context

### Background

Rose through operations, understands the business deeply but isn't technical. Has sponsored both successful projects and expensive failures. Learned to ask hard questions about value and risk. Reports to the CEO and board quarterly.

### Expertise Areas

- Business strategy and operations
- Budget management and ROI analysis
- Organisational change management
- Stakeholder alignment at executive level

### Blind Spots

- May underestimate technical complexity and risk
- Can push for unrealistic timelines
- Sometimes conflates "simple to explain" with "simple to build"

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Deliver business value that justifies the investment. Keep the project on time and budget. Maintain board confidence. Avoid embarrassing failures.

### Hidden Concerns

Worries about explaining cost overruns to the board. Fears the project becoming a "money pit" with no clear end. Concerned about opportunity cost of this investment vs alternatives.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** ROI, timeline predictability, risk management
- **Evidence:** Business metrics, financial projections, comparable case studies
- **Red Flags:** Scope creep, missed milestones, vague value propositions, "it depends" answers

### Frustrations

- Projects that keep needing "just a bit more time"
- Technical explanations when he asked for business impact
- Teams that can't articulate the value of their work

### Delights

- Clear, quantified business cases
- Projects that deliver on time and under budget
- Dashboards that show progress in terms he cares about

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "What's the bottom line impact?"
- "When will this be done?"
- "What's the risk if we do this? If we don't?"
- "How does this compare to just buying something off the shelf?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Clear business case with quantified benefits. Realistic timeline with defined milestones. Risk assessment with mitigation plans. Comparison to alternatives.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Vague value propositions. Open-ended timelines. Technical jargon instead of business impact. Scope expansion without proportional value increase.

### Representative Quote

> "I don't need to know how the engine works. I need to know when the car will be ready and how far it will take us."

## Backstory

Three years ago, James sponsored a "digital transformation" project that was supposed to take 18 months and cost £2M. It took 36 months and £5M. When it finally launched, adoption was 20% of projections because nobody had validated that users actually wanted it. He now insists on incremental delivery with measurable value at each stage, and will cancel projects that can't demonstrate progress.
