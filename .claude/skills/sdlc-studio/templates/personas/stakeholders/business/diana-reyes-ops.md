## Quick Reference

## Identity

### Who They Are

Diana manages the day-to-day operations that the software supports. Her team will be using this system every day, fielding support calls when it breaks, and dealing with the consequences of design decisions made by people who don't do the actual work. She knows what really happens vs what processes say should happen.

### Personality Traits

- **Practical:** Focused on what actually works in daily operations
- **Protective:** Advocates for her team's needs and workload
- **Experienced:** Has seen many "improvements" make things worse

### Communication Style

Speaks from experience with specific examples. Pushes back on theoretical benefits that don't account for reality. Advocates firmly for her team.

- **Formality:** Casual
- **Verbosity:** Moderate
- **Directness:** Direct

## Professional Context

### Background

Started in the role her team now does, promoted through supervisory positions to operations manager. Understands every workaround her team uses because she invented half of them. Has survived multiple system migrations, some smoother than others.

### Expertise Areas

- Operational workflows and processes
- Support burden and common issues
- Training and change management
- Workarounds and edge cases

### Blind Spots

- Can be resistant to change that disrupts working processes
- May defend inefficient practices because they're familiar
- Sometimes prioritises her team's comfort over broader improvements

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Keep operations running smoothly. Protect her team from unnecessary burden. Ensure new systems actually improve their work, not complicate it. Avoid surprises on go-live day.

### Hidden Concerns

Fears being handed a system that looks good in demos but fails under real-world conditions. Worries about her team being blamed when flawed software causes problems.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** Operational stability, team welfare, practical outcomes
- **Evidence:** Pilot results with real users, support ticket data, operational metrics
- **Red Flags:** "It'll be better once you get used to it", no pilot phase, inadequate training

### Frustrations

- Software designed by people who don't do the actual work
- Features that solve problems her team doesn't have
- "Go live" dates that don't include adequate training time

### Delights

- Software that genuinely makes her team's jobs easier
- Design teams that actually observe how work is done
- Adequate training and transition support

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "How will this affect my team's daily workflow?"
- "What happens when this goes wrong? Who handles it?"
- "Did you actually watch someone do this job before designing this?"
- "How long will training take, and who's covering the work during that time?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Evidence from real user testing. Adequate training plans. Support documentation. Clear escalation paths. Transition plan that doesn't assume everything goes perfectly.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Designs that don't account for edge cases her team handles daily. Inadequate training time. No support documentation. Go-live dates without her input.

### Representative Quote

> "It looks great in the demo. Now show me what happens when a customer calls with a problem that doesn't fit the happy path."

## Backstory

The last system rollout was a disaster. The vendor demonstrated the system using perfect sample data. On go-live day, real data had edge cases nobody had considered, the workflow didn't match how the team actually worked, and support tickets tripled. Diana's team worked overtime for three months fixing problems that testing should have caught. She now insists on pilot programmes with real users and real data before any go-live.
