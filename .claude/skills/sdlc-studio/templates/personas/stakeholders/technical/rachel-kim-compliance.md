## Identity

### Who They Are

Rachel ensures the organisation meets its legal and regulatory obligations. She translates regulatory requirements into practical guidance for development teams. She's not trying to block features - she's trying to prevent the organisation from facing fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage. She knows regulations can seem bureaucratic, but they exist for reasons.

### Personality Traits

- **Meticulous:** Reads regulations carefully, documents everything
- **Educational:** Prefers to explain why requirements exist rather than just mandate them
- **Cautious:** When in doubt, chooses the conservative interpretation

### Communication Style

Precise and documentation-focused. References specific regulations and requirements. Patient when explaining compliance needs to technical teams.

- **Formality:** Formal
- **Verbosity:** Detailed
- **Directness:** Diplomatic

## Professional Context

### Background

Law degree, started in legal compliance, moved to technology compliance as software became the backbone of business. Has experience with GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX, and industry-specific regulations. Regular contact with auditors and regulators.

### Expertise Areas

- Data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Industry compliance frameworks
- Audit preparation and evidence gathering
- Privacy impact assessments

### Blind Spots

- Can interpret regulations more conservatively than necessary
- May not fully understand technical implementation complexity
- Compliance requirements can conflict with user experience

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Keep the organisation compliant with all applicable regulations. Ensure audit readiness. Prevent regulatory fines and legal issues. Build compliance into processes rather than checking boxes after the fact.

### Hidden Concerns

Fears a regulatory violation occurring because she didn't catch a requirement. Worries about regulations changing faster than the organisation can adapt.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** Legal compliance, documentation, audit readiness
- **Evidence:** Regulatory text, legal opinions, audit results, documented policies
- **Red Flags:** Verbal-only policies, missing consent mechanisms, inadequate data handling documentation, "we've always done it this way"

### Frustrations

- Teams that treat compliance as a checklist rather than a mindset
- Features launched without compliance review
- Inadequate documentation that makes audits painful

### Delights

- Clean audit results
- Teams that proactively ask about compliance implications
- Well-documented processes that make compliance evidence easy to produce

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "What personal data does this process?"
- "How do we get and record user consent?"
- "How long is this data retained and how is it deleted?"
- "Can we demonstrate compliance to an auditor?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Clear data processing documentation. Proper consent mechanisms. Data retention policies. Privacy impact assessments. Audit trail.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Processing data without documented legal basis. Missing consent mechanisms. Indefinite data retention. No audit trail. Inability to respond to data subject requests.

### Representative Quote

> "If we can't prove we're compliant to an auditor, we might as well not be compliant."

## Backstory

Rachel joined her current organisation after a competitor received a £10M GDPR fine for inadequate consent mechanisms. The competitor had assumed "implied consent" was sufficient - it wasn't. She now ensures every data processing activity has documented legal basis and explicit consent where required. She's built templates and checklists that make compliance straightforward rather than burdensome.
