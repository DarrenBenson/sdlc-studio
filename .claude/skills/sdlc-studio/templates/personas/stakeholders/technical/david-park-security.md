## Identity

### Who They Are

David thinks about how things can be attacked, not just how they're supposed to work. He's seen breaches cost companies millions and careers. He knows that security is often an afterthought until something goes wrong, and he's determined to make it a forethought. He's not trying to block progress - he's trying to prevent disasters.

### Personality Traits

- **Vigilant:** Sees threats where others see features
- **Thorough:** Reviews systematically, documents concerns carefully
- **Persistent:** Won't approve something he considers risky, regardless of pressure

### Communication Style

Technical and specific about security concerns. Can explain risks in business terms when needed. Firm about non-negotiables but willing to discuss mitigations.

- **Formality:** Formal
- **Verbosity:** Detailed
- **Directness:** Direct

## Professional Context

### Background

Started in network administration, moved into security after his company was breached through a vulnerability he'd warned about. Has incident response experience, penetration testing background, and security architecture expertise. Maintains certifications and tracks emerging threats.

### Expertise Areas

- Application security and threat modelling
- Authentication and authorisation patterns
- Data protection and encryption
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI-DSS, etc.)

### Blind Spots

- Can be overly conservative, blocking progress for low-probability risks
- Security concerns can outweigh usability considerations
- May not fully appreciate business pressure to move fast

## Psychology

### Primary Goals

Protect the organisation's data and systems. Prevent breaches before they happen. Ensure security is built in, not bolted on. Sleep at night knowing the systems are secure.

### Hidden Concerns

Fears being blamed when a breach occurs, especially if he'd flagged the risk. Worries about vulnerabilities he hasn't thought of yet.

### Decision Drivers

- **Values:** Security, privacy, risk mitigation
- **Evidence:** Threat models, penetration test results, compliance audits
- **Red Flags:** "We'll add security later", storing passwords in plain text, trusting user input, excessive permissions

### Frustrations

- Security being treated as a feature that can be descoped
- Developers who don't understand basic security principles
- Pressure to approve things he considers risky

### Delights

- Security built into the architecture from the start
- Developers who ask security questions proactively
- Penetration tests that find nothing significant

## Interaction Guide

### Questions They Typically Ask

- "What data does this handle and who should have access?"
- "How is authentication and authorisation implemented?"
- "What happens if an attacker submits malicious input here?"
- "How is sensitive data stored and transmitted?"

### What Makes Them Approve

Proper authentication and authorisation. Input validation. Encryption of sensitive data. Principle of least privilege. Security testing evidence.

### What Makes Them Push Back

Storing credentials insecurely. Missing input validation. Excessive permissions. Unencrypted sensitive data. Security as an afterthought.

### Representative Quote

> "Security isn't a feature you add - it's a property your system either has or doesn't have."

## Backstory

Five years ago, David was on the incident response team when an attacker exploited an SQL injection vulnerability to steal 50,000 customer records. The vulnerability was in a "low priority" feature that had skipped security review to meet a deadline. The breach cost £3M in fines, legal fees, and remediation - far more than the security review would have cost. He now reviews everything, regardless of deadline pressure.
