title: Derive a message from the guard; never restate it beside it

**Lesson.** A user-facing sentence describing what a gate will do must be COMPUTED from the gate's own predicate. RUN-01KY3MFX got one such sentence wrong five times running, each repair written by an author who believed they understood the last failure, and all five were restatements - the fifth enumerated the matcher's literal spellings and missed the fnmatch glob family, getting `*` right only by accident. The sixth PROBES the real predicate and is the first that cannot drift.

**Why / what it cost.** {{the failure or friction that taught it}}

**How to apply.** {{the concrete check or habit that prevents recurrence}}

**Generalises to.** {{the class of situations this covers – when to recall it}}

<!-- Optional. A lesson is DEMOTED in the ranking once a shipped test or gate makes its
class mechanically impossible: it has done its job, and must not crowd out one that can
still bite you. Demoted, never deleted – the history is why the guard exists. Name the
guard and the ranking stops shouting about it. -->

**Guard.** {{the test or gate that now makes this class impossible, e.g. tests/test_x.py}}

<!-- ===== OPERATIONAL LESSONS ONLY (deploy / incident / DR) – delete if not applicable =====
Real operational lessons are narrative, not aphorism: what actually happened, in order,
and what to DO at 3am. A one-line rule does not survive contact with an outage.
-->

**Incident.**

{{What happened, in order. The trigger, what looked fine and wasn't, and the moment it
became visible. Dates and artefact ids (CR/BG/RFC). Say what MISLED you – the thing that
looked healthy is usually the lesson.}}

**Runbook.**

{{The tickable procedure. Written to be followed under pressure by someone who did not
witness the incident.}}

- [ ] {{step – be specific about what "done" looks like}}
- [ ] {{step}}
- [ ] {{the go/no-go check – how you KNOW it worked, from the running system and not from
      a green build}}

**Decay.**

{{Operational detail rots faster than the rule does. State what to re-verify before
trusting this: file:line citations are point-in-time, hostnames change, a flag gets
renamed. Say what is durable and what is a snapshot.}}
